Baljeet Tjinder is a boy from India who has helped Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher with their Big Ideas.

Baljeet is an Indian boy who always gets good grades and is constantly bullied by Buford. He's considered a nerd and, for him, to get an F on a math test is the scariest thing known to man ("One Good Scare Ought to Do It!"). He has moved to Danville from India for his education. He can play various instruments, including the drums and the guitar. Although it seems like all his feelings make him want to do math, he actually just does a lot of math, "the feelings come and go" ("The Baljeatles").

He is great at math, passive, and very polite. He enjoys trivia ("Let's Take a Quiz"), learning, and has a compelling need to get good grades ("One Good Scare Ought to Do It!", "Tip of the Day", "Unfair Science Fair", "The Baljeatles"). Baljeet is also the leader of a group of science fiction fans, and is the only sixteenth level Space Adventure Trivia Master in the world ("Nerds of a Feather"). He speaks without contractions, perhaps due to his studious background or because English is his second language. He also has an irrational fear of contractions ("Monster from the Id").

During the group's activities, he is often paired with Buford. While Buford often bullies him by taking his underpants, there is also a protective nature between the two of them ("Get That Bigfoot Outa My Face!", "The Ballad of Badbeard", "The Beak"). He also learns things he never knew Buford could do ("Tip of the Day", "The Baljeatles", "Unfair Science Fair", "Phineas and Ferb: Summer Belongs to You!", "Meatloaf Surprise").
